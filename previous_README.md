<h1>What this is</h1>
A custom page for me to customize what I see from my Yahoo Fantasy Hockey team

<h2>What it aims to do</h2>
Yahoo's base layout is annoying. Wasted space, inefficient layout, things I want to compare spread across different pages. So I want to make something simple just for me.
Something where I can see how my players are doing for that day, somewhere for me to add players that may be on the waiver wire/trade targets for the future, so I can quickly compare them to my current roster.

<h2>How it plans to do it</h2>
It'll be a very simple layout that I can customize rather quickly. It'll look something like this
<img src="https://github.com/MrDiamondNL/Fantasy-Homepage/blob/main/images/CleanerLayout.jpg?sanitize=true&raw=true" alt="Quick Layout Sketch" width="600" height="800" />
The right side will have a search bar to look up players to add to a watchlist. This section, maybe in the future, also be able to load the weeks opposing team. But thats a future feature

<h2>What I would like to do eventually</h2>
When I get the base features figured out and working, I would like to eventually add a way to quick import my opponents team, just to quickly see how the mathup is going. Nothing that the fantasy app doesn't currently do, but in a condensed version that I think looks better
<h2>What it doesn't plan to do (May Change)</h2>
For simplicity's sake, this is just meant to be a reference page. AS of right now, no plans to adjust lineups, starting players, rosters, etc. Maybe in the future, but for now this is just for quick reference and planning only
