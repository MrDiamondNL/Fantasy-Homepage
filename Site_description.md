Hi Everybody!

Let me show off my Module One Project, a custom fantasy hockey roster tracker (with some extra website flavorings to show off some JavaScript skills). While itâ€™s beginnings are quite humble now, my longer term goal is to create my own fantasy hockey dashboard so I can customize what I want to see, and ignore the awful Yahoo site.

To start, this site is best viewed on desktop and will require a browser extension to enable CORS to view data from the NHL API. I suggest Allow Cors for Chrome.

The main feature of the site is the roster builder, a way for you to add players from your fantasy team as well as a spot for any players you may be interested in. Just enter the player's name, and click either button to add that player to the respective list, and it will show that player's relevant (for my fantasy league) stats. And having the second Watchlist allows me to have something I can quickly add players to for watching and keeping track, in my example I have my playoffs opponents team listed.

Besides that, a couple other niceties I wanted to add was the game tracker at the top, that displays the current days matchups at the top as well as score when the game starts. And with Playoff hockey less than a month away, there's a standings page where you can quickly see the race for those Wildcard spots. And to give it that real sports feel, there would have to be something to spend money on, so I included a mock shop as well.

I have to give an enormous thank you to @Gillian and her seemingly endless energy for helping guide me through this project and helping me overcome so many strange issues I faced. I'd also like to thank someone not in this group but some people may know, my good friend and local developer Motaz Khalil, whose eye for design really helped me bring the look of the site together.
